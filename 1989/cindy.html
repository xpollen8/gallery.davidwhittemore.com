			<div class="body">Cindy is from New Jersey, and was on the staff of <i>The Debris</i> at the same time I was (1987-1988). <p /> We got along great and she introduced me her world. She loved to take photos, and she (now) loves to write - she is back in New Jersey now, attending graduate school in creative writing.  I don't call her enough. <p /> We would often take off in her car into the unexplored countryside around Purdue University to find things to point our cameras at. <p /> Our favorite find was a farmhouse that had obviously been abandoned about a decade before.  Vandals had not quite looted the place - it was scattered with old clothes, fragments of magazines and personal papers, and the garage contained a Ford pick-up truck from the 40's.  Whoever left there left in a hurry - they didn't take anything with them.  Lots of images just waiting. <p /> I have gone back since, and it just depresses me now - the vandals have discovered the place, and the weather has taken its toll. <p /> The "glasses" picture above is not from the farmhouse, but was taken at Axel Rose's favorite ice cream joint in LaFayette, Indiana, the ancient <b>Frozen Custard</b> drive-up soda shop.  Cindy was leaving Purdue for good, and Frozen Custard was on her list of essential photo-memories. So I took some too.  I like this image; Cindy didn't usually smile much.</div>
