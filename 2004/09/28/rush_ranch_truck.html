			<div class="title">Rush Ranch Truck</div>
			<div class="body">Rush Ranch is a 2,000 acre ranch in Solano County, California which borders some the last remaining un-managed marshland in California. <p /> The land is under preservation protection, and the grounds are open to the public during the day. <p /> A group out of San Francisco run by Tim Baskerville - The Nocturnes - brought 15 people to the ranch for an evening of semi-guided night photography, with an emphasis on "light painting". <p /> Light Painting is a technique where, during a minutes-long exposure, one "paints" the subject with gel-covered flashlights, strobes, or anything else that illuminates the scene in a controlled manner. <p /> This was my first attempt at light painting, and the result is pretty interesting.  This image is a composite of 3 separate 2-minute exposures.  Two of the exposures are of painting with light - combined with a "difference filter", which makes for nice tree outlines. The third is a "dark frame" - taken with with the lens cap on.  Dark frames are used to "subtract out" (in photoshop) the noise inherent in digital cameras. <p /> For this sort of work, the Nikon Coolpix 995 is crap.  The dudes with the $3000 Canons ruled the night. <p /> The REST of the pictures I took that night are old-school 4x5 (yeah, i dug out the Speed Graphic) color 64 ISO slide film - each of which required a 20 minute exposure, or 35mm with 160 ISO slide film.  Depending how they turn out, another side gallery may be warranted.</div>
