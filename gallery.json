I sort of believe the tale that the Dragon mascot was a Clan-related land-grant exchange agreement for the high school.<p/>However, in the 70's my father ran a recording studio which was very popular with the soul and funk groups of Indianapolis at the time, so we managed to sneak a few unsavory elements into the county.<p/>Some of my most vivid memories of childhood involved the fact that our living room had been transformed into a recording studio, and I would often fall asleep to wailing guitars and Leslies for Wurlitzers stuck in the hall (reverb, you know).  It was always a kick to have my father come to \"career day\" at school, where parents would explain what they did for a living.  They must have thought he was from Mars.<p/>My parents still live in New Palestine.  The studio was closed officially in 1982 after 10 years, and my father resumed the real, boring life as a digital transmission computer designer for Allison Engine (a GM division) in Indianapolis.

Yup, my multi-talented father was among those strong-armed from work.<p/>Maurice Whittemore Jr is a fucking genius, no doubt about it.

This image is a composite of 3 separate 2-minute exposures.  Two of the exposures are of painting with light - combined with a \"difference filter\", which makes for nice tree outlines. The third is a \"dark frame\" - taken with with the lens cap on.  Dark frames are used to \"subtract out\" (in photoshop) the noise inherent in digital cameras.<p/>For this sort of work, the Nikon Coolpix 995 is crap.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.  (AP) _ Thousands of chanting spectators lined  up early Wednesday to watch more than 100  Purdue University students throw caution to  the wind to join in the recently banned  annual ''Nude Olympics.''<p/>Two students were arrested and scores face  disciplinary action ranging from probation to  expulsion, officials said.<p/>Extreme cold during last year's run around  Cary Quad prompted Purdue President Steven  Beering to ban the event this year. This time,  however, the temperature was a relatively  mild 38 degrees.<p/>At least 20 plainclothes campus police  officers attempted to stop the nude runners,  but only netted two arrests.<p/>Police Chief John Woods was the only known  casualty, according to Joe Bennett, director of  university relations.<p/>''Police were routinely stopping runners and  getting names,'' Bennett said. ''One runner  refused to do that and he bolted and ran into  Woods. The two fell and there was a pileup.'' As Woods tried to get up, Bennett said, one  runner in the pileup took a swing at the  police chief, who suffered cuts and bruises. One student was arrested for allegedly  assaulting Woods. Another was arrested for  alleged public intoxication and resisting law  officers, Bennett said. The cases were turned  over to the county prosecutor.<p/>Meanwhile, police and residence hall  supervisors were busy later Wednesday  compiling names of participants in the run. ''Disciplinary measures will be on a case-by- case basis,'' Bennett said.<p/>''I don't really care what Beering says,'' said  runner Andy Banta, 20. ''I ran to have some  fun. It's something different to do. It's not  really as cold as the past few years.'' Beering was asleep during the race, which  began about midnight, according to a man  who answered the telephone at Beering's  home.<p/>The university president said later in the day  that violation of the ban would not be taken  lightly.<p/>School officials also are considering  disciplinary measures against 12 male  students who staged another nude run  Sunday night.  </blockquote>","thumb":"https://davidwhittemore.com/images/gallery/thumb/500/cary_quad_nude_olympics.jpg","caption":"Cary Quad Nude Olympics","date":"1987-01-27","blogdate":"1987/01/27","blogtitle":"cary_quad_nude_olympics","blogurl":"1987/01/27/cary_quad_nude_olympics.html"},{"gallery_id":277,"image":"https://davidwhittemore.com/images/gallery/death_chuck_mohawk.jpg","uri":"death_chuck_mohawk","width":500,"height":720, "alt":"Death Chuck's Mohawk","year":"1986","dt":"1986-10-10","camera":"Nikon FM2","media":"Tri-X","acquisition":"print scan","lens":"85mm","tags":["camera:Nikon FM2","hair","lens:85mm","media:Tri-X","mohawk","year:1986"],"body":"\"Death Chuck\" was the only name I knew this Purdue student by.<p/>We'd run into each other in casual situation - at parties, in the hallway of the Union, etc.<p/>The last time I did run into him on campus - years after I had graduated - he asked me \"you're still here?\"<p/>And I guess he had a point.<p/>Fortunately, the WWW was invented and I moved on.","thumb":"https://davidwhittemore.com/images/gallery/thumb/500/death_chuck_mohawk.jpg","caption":"Death Chuck's Mohawk","date":"1986-10-10","blogdate":"1986/10/10","blogtitle":"death_chuck_s_mohawk","blogurl":"1986/10/10/death_chuck_s_mohawk.html"},{"gallery_id":278,"image":"https://davidwhittemore.com/images/gallery/allison_frody_ocean.jpg","uri":"allison_frody_ocean","width":500,"height":744, "alt":"Allison Froyd Ocenside","year":"1987","dt":"1987-11-27","camera":"Nikon FM2","media":"Tri-X","acquisition":"print scan","lens":"85mm","tags":["allison","camera:Nikon FM2","lens:85mm","media:Tri-X","year:1987"],"body":"I believe this was taken at the Atlantic Ocean.<p/>a la plage a Connecticut.","thumb":"https://davidwhittemore.com/images/gallery/thumb/500/allison_frody_ocean.jpg","caption":"Allison Froyd Ocenside","date":"1987-11-27","blogdate":"1987/11/27","blogtitle":"allison_froyd_ocenside","blogurl":"1987/11/27/allison_froyd_ocenside.html"},{"gallery_id":279,"image":"https://davidwhittemore.com/images/gallery/gothic_girl.jpg","uri":"gothic_girl","width":500,"height":726, "alt":"Gothic Girl By Firelight","year":"1989","dt":"1989-00-00","camera":"Nikon FM2","media":"TMZ","acquisition":"print scan","lens":"85mm","tags":["camera:Nikon FM2","lens:85mm","media:TMZ","year:1989"],"body":"I ended up tagging along with a bunch of  kids to the countryside outside Purdue.
