			<div class="body">My Grandmother. <p /> She was an extraordinary woman.  Mother of my father. Mother of 7.  Talented, beautiful, spirited.  Her husband called her "Gladys". <p /> Born in Hartford, CT, her parents came from Poland.  Occasionally, she would throw out phrases in Polish, but she did not have an accent whatsoever. <p /> A very early photograph of she and my grandfather together have them dressed as Bonnie and Clyde - she in her flapper dress, he with a wide-brimmed hat.  Both loving life. <p /> This is a picture of the grandmother I remember, the  grandmother I grew up around, the grandmother  who made huge perfect turkeys at Thanksgiving and scolded her adult children for saying off-color things. <p /> This is my grandmother from before.. <p /> My grandmother was consumed by Alzheimer's. <p /> The infrequent times I saw her after this photograph was taken left me at a complete loss. In just a few years she became incapable of knowing who anyone was. She walked non-stop in the nursing home. She sang to herself in Polish. Her face bloated, her shoulders bent.  She did not smile. <p /> If there was anything inside trying to communicate through the confusion, it must have been terrified.  I can think of no worse way to fade from life. <p /> <b> Lladislava Petronella Davidovitch-Whittemore <br> b. 1911-06-23<br/> d. 2000-01-30 </b> <p /> Medium format</div>
