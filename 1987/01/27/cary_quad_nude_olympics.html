			<div class="body">As quoted elsewhere on the '"net": <blockquote> Purdue had the nude olympics where on one of the coldest days of winter, people would gather in the courtyard of Cary Quad, strip and run a lap or two around the courtyard.  The school decided to put a stop to this long standing tradition by having undercover police photograph the participants.  Most people wore masks so they got the RAs involved to identify the offending tallywackers. </blockquote> So - here's proof that it happened. <p /> The year previous to this, the year the campus police started cracking down, I was a participant - and ran 25 laps around the ~quarter mile Quad. <p /> It was c-o-l-d, damn betcha. <p /> And I didn't get caught. <p /> This report is for the year I "ran": <blockquote> AP , Associated Press Jan. 22, 1986 1:56 PM ET <p /> WEST LAFAYETTE, IND. WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.  (AP) _ Thousands of chanting spectators lined  up early Wednesday to watch more than 100  Purdue University students throw caution to  the wind to join in the recently banned  annual ''Nude Olympics.'' <p /> Two students were arrested and scores face  disciplinary action ranging from probation to  expulsion, officials said. <p /> Extreme cold during last year's run around  Cary Quad prompted Purdue President Steven  Beering to ban the event this year. This time,  however, the temperature was a relatively  mild 38 degrees. <p /> At least 20 plainclothes campus police  officers attempted to stop the nude runners,  but only netted two arrests. <p /> Police Chief John Woods was the only known  casualty, according to Joe Bennett, director of  university relations. <p /> ''Police were routinely stopping runners and  getting names,'' Bennett said. ''One runner  refused to do that and he bolted and ran into  Woods. The two fell and there was a pileup.'' As Woods tried to get up, Bennett said, one  runner in the pileup took a swing at the  police chief, who suffered cuts and bruises. One student was arrested for allegedly  assaulting Woods. Another was arrested for  alleged public intoxication and resisting law  officers, Bennett said. The cases were turned  over to the county prosecutor. <p /> Meanwhile, police and residence hall  supervisors were busy later Wednesday  compiling names of participants in the run. ''Disciplinary measures will be on a case-by- case basis,'' Bennett said. <p /> ''I don't really care what Beering says,'' said  runner Andy Banta, 20. ''I ran to have some  fun. It's something different to do. It's not  really as cold as the past few years.'' Beering was asleep during the race, which  began about midnight, according to a man  who answered the telephone at Beering's  home. <p /> The university president said later in the day  that violation of the ban would not be taken  lightly. <p /> School officials also are considering  disciplinary measures against 12 male  students who staged another nude run  Sunday night.  </blockquote></div>
