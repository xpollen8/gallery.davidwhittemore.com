			<div class="body">That damned Corvair. <p /> Since 1990, I have been trying to restore a 1964 Corvair Monza Coupe. <p /> I bought it for $250 from a stranger and then dumped most of my meager earnings into it while I was still working at Purdue. <p /> While living in a small space I called "The Headphone Room" ( it measured 4'x10' with a sloping ceiling and I surrounded my mattress on the floor with my absurdely expensive  Quad Electrostatic Loudspeakers ) I worked on the Corvair. <p /> The engine was professionally rebuilt, but I tackled the bodywork myself.  I sandblasted everything.  I learned how to handle an Oxy/Acetelene torch.  I painted it with very toxic paints. I have probably given myself silicosis. <p /> I spent a lot of money, but then I ran out of steam. <p /> I started refering to it as "sculpture". <p /> I moved to California, and the company that hired me unwittingly helped ship the Corvair out.  It sat in yet another garage for a few months until I found a "professional" to finish the restoration. <p /> It took the guy nearly 3 years to just rebuild the engine (again) and get it roadworthy enough for me to drive it 150 miles (at 45 MPH) to the garage it is now sitting in. <p /> Part of me is ashamed, part of me just wants the thing to go away. <p /> 'Round these parts, you can <b>buy</b> a Corvair in better shape than a restored Midwestern car - right off the street!</div>
