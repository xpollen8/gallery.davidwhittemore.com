			<div class="body">The Leonids Meteor shower of 18 Nov 2001 was the best such event since 1966 and it is reckoned that it will be the best until 2099.<p /> I rented a car, packed up my recently (as in that day) replaced camping equipment, and drove west and south until the skies were dark. <p /> I ended up in a place called Hope Valley, which is in the California Sierras at 7000 feet. <p /> It was cold, damnit. <p /> I slept most of the next day in preparation for the big show. <p /> At around 1am I got up, set up the camera and took my first astrophotographs. I had read just enough online about exposures to not completely botch it, and in the end, I captured quite a number of meteors until I collapsed around dawn. <p /> This is one of the few pictures on the roll that didn't have any meteors, but it was too beautiful to not put on display.  Feeling dizzy? <p /> At any rate, the *real* meteor photographs are in their own section of the gallery <a href="/htdb/gallery/2001leonids.html">over here</a>.</div>
